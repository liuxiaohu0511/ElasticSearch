### Explore data
letâ€™s try to work on a more realistic dataset and you can download the file from `https://github.com/xiaohu-liu/ElasticSearch/blob/master/Data%20sample/accounts.json`

The data structure:
```
{
    "account_number": 0,
    "balance": 16623,
    "firstname": "Bradshaw",
    "lastname": "Mckenzie",
    "age": 29,
    "gender": "F",
    "address": "244 Columbus Place",
    "employer": "Euron",
    "email": "bradshawmckenzie@euron.com",
    "city": "Hobucken",
    "state": "CO"
}
```
### Load the sample data
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST 'localhost:9200/bank/account/_bulk?pretty&refresh' --data-binary "@accounts.json"
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```
the repsonse text as follow:
```
health status index uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   bank  l7sSYV2cQXmu6_4rJWVIww   5   1       1000            0    128.6kb        128.6kb
```

Which means that we just successfully bulk indexed 1000 documents into the bank index (under the account type).
